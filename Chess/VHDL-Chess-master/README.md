This Game Includes all the chess pieces and each one is bound to the proper movements.

This doesn't includes Castleing, Check/Checkmate/Stalemate, En passant, or turn order. Pawns will auto promote to Queens.

This Project was compiled using Xilinx ISE 14.7. It includes the constraint file, A bitstream, and all the VHDLs. It takes about 3 hours to generate the project, but this can be reduced to 30 minutes by deleting the cases for moving each peice.
